The house was quiet and the world was call.  
The reader became the book; and summer night  

Was like the conscious being of the book.  
The house was quiet and the world was calm.  

The words were spoken as if there was no book,  
Except that the reader leaned above the page,  

Wanted to lean, wanted much most to be  
The scholar to whom his book is true, to whom  

The summer night is like a perfection of thought.  
The house was quiet because it had to be.
